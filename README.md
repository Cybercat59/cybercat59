## About Me
- 🎯 **Aspiring Red Teamer** and offensive security enthusiast transitioning from **Level 2 Technical Support**.
- 🏪 Formerly with **Lowe’s**, where I honed incident response, troubleshooting, and lateral thinking under pressure.
- 🔑 Recently earned **CompTIA Security+** and **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)**.
- 🧪 Passionate about building, breaking, and documenting — from **vulnerability discovery** to **post-exploitation**.
  

## Red Team Focus Areas
- **Recon & OSINT**: Amass intel with tools like `theHarvester`, Maltego, Recon-ng
- **Network Exploitation**: Nmap, CrackMapExec, SMB & RDP enumeration, password spraying
- **Web App Testing**: OWASP Top 10, Burp Suite, SQLi/XSS, SSRF, CSRF, file upload abuse
- **Wireless Security**: WPA2 cracking, rogue AP simulation
- **Social Engineering**: Phishing frameworks (GoPhish), payload delivery techniques
- **Exploitation & Post-Exploitation**: Metasploit, Cobalt Strike (training), PowerShell Empire
- **Privilege Escalation**: Linux/Windows escalation, misconfig exploitation
- **Reporting**: Clear, actionable pen test reports for technical and executive audiences

## Highlighted Labs & Projects
- 🕵️ **Adversary Simulation Lab** — Simulate APT-style intrusion in homelab, from initial access to data exfil  
  Repo: [`adversary-sim-lab`](https://github.com/cybercat59/adversary-sim-lab)
- 🐍 **Python Exploit Toolkit** — PoC scripts f enumeration, payload generation, and automation  
  Repo: [`python-offsec-tools`](https://github.com/cybercat59/python-offsec-tools)
- 🌐 **Web Exploitation Playground** — OWASP Top 10 attack practice with DVWA & Juice Shop

- 📨 **Phishing Simulation Framework** — Build and track campaigns safely in lab  
  Repo: [`phish-lab`](https://github.com/cybercat59/phish-lab)

## Certifications
- CompTIA **Security+**
- Microsoft **Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)**

## Recent Wins
- Promoted to **Level 2 Technical Support** for SLA-beating resolution rates and team mentoring.
- Built a Red Team homelab: Kali Linux, Windows AD domain, vulnerable web apps, simulated phishing campaigns.
- Automated enumeration workflows with Python + Bash.

## How I Work
- Always **document**: every finding, step, and tool used.
- Balance stealth and speed in simulated engagements.
- Focus on reproducible labs and clean READMEs so others can follow.

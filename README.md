# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub â€” cybercat59

My name is **Chase**, and I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a passion for **offensive security** and **red teaming**. I made a career transition into tech, starting as an intern and quickly proving myself â€” first as a contractor, then earning a full-time role as a **Level 1 Technical Support Technician**. Through hands-on experience and continuous growth, I was promoted to **Level 2 Technical Support Technician**, where I deepened my technical knowledge and refined my troubleshooting skills.

I graduated from **California State University, Long Beach (CSULB)** and have since earned both the **CompTIA Security+ CE** and **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)** certifications. Iâ€™m now fully committed to breaking into the cybersecurity field â€” specifically in **penetration testing** â€” and constantly improving through independent learning and real-world lab work.

This GitHub is my **fresh start**. After deleting my old profile, I built this new space to showcase only my **most current, clean, and independently developed cybersecurity labs**. The work here is **completely separate from CSULB** and highlights my personal initiative. Each repository is clearly documented, visually supported, and focused on foundational red team and blue team skills. More advanced content is on the way as I continue my deep dive into ethical hacking and offensive security.

Thanks for stopping by â€” feel free to connect.
